/**
 * The controller against a partial, duck-typed host.
 *
 * `SuperDocEditorLike` accepts a host that carries only the operations it
 * implements, which is what makes custom adapters and test stubs possible. That
 * permissiveness is only safe because every route the controller offers
 * resolves its document operation defensively and fails closed when it is
 * missing. These tests pin that, because the failure mode is silent: a route
 * that assumed an operation exists would throw out of a click handler instead
 * of reporting an unavailable command, and nothing else in the suite mounts a
 * host this sparse.
 *
 * The one surface that is NOT guarded is `ctx.doc`, the host's own object
 * passed straight through. That is why it is typed
 * `PartialBrowserDocumentApi`: it promises only what the host contract
 * guarantees, so a consumer reaching past the routed helpers has to guard.
