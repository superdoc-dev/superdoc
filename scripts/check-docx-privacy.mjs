/**
 * DOCX fixture privacy gate.
 *
 * Every `.docx` in this repository is a ZIP archive, so the text-based export
 * scans never see inside one. Real documents carry the identity of whoever
 * authored them: `dc:creator`, `cp:lastModifiedBy`, `<Company>`, comment and
 * tracked-change authors, and SharePoint/DMS taxonomy in `customXml`. A fixture
 * copied from a real document publishes all of it.
 *
 * This gate unpacks each tracked fixture and fails on any identity that is not
 * an approved synthetic one.
 *
 * Why an allowlist of names rather than a denylist:
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * We cannot enumerate every real person who might ever author a fixture, but we
 * can enumerate the handful of synthetic identities tests are allowed to use.
 * Anything else is unreviewed by construction, which is the correct default for
 * a public repository.
 *
 * Run directly:
 *   node scripts/check-docx-privacy.mjs
 *   pnpm run check:docx-privacy
 *
 * To approve a new synthetic identity, add it to SYNTHETIC_IDENTITIES below.
 * To sanitize an offending fixture in place, use scripts/sanitize-docx.mjs.
