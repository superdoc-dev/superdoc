/**
 * Compatibility for existing custom-UI consumers.
 *
 * This branch changed who owns the controller: the built-in toolbar, link
 * popover and shortcut routing each used to build their own, and now share the
 * one the instance owns. The ownership tests elsewhere prove the object graph is
 * right. They do not prove the *editing experience* is unchanged, which is the
 * risk that matters to an application already shipping custom UI.
 *
 * Two shapes are covered here, and they are different situations:
 *
 *  - An application that calls `createSuperDocUI()` itself and also renders the
 *    built-in toolbar. That is now two controllers over one host, where it used
 *    to be two controllers over one host as well, so nothing should have moved.
 *    This is the existing-consumer case, and it is the reason this file exists.
 *  - An application reading `superdoc.ui` alongside the built-in toolbar. That
 *    is now one controller with two readers, which is the genuinely new shape.
 *
 * `bullet-list` is the command driven here rather than bold. Bold routes
 * through the Document API and reports `range-selection-required` without a
 * selection surface, so driving it would mean stubbing selection as well and
 * testing the stub. `bullet-list` routes through `editCommands.lists.apply`,
 * which is observable directly, and exercises the same execute-then-recompute
 * path. Bold is still used below, for the failure-reason half: an unsupported
 * reason has to reach both consumers identically too.
