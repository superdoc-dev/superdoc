/**
 * Late async search results must not write into state that has moved on.
 *
 * `search()` captures `searchRequestGeneration` and re-checks it before
 * publishing. The other asynchronous entry points did not: `next()`,
 * `previous()`, `replace()` and `replaceAll()` all reach
 * `applyHostSearchResult` from a `.then(...)` with nothing compared. A
 * worker-backed call that settles after the session closed, after the active
 * editor changed, or after the controller was destroyed would republish the
 * previous document's match state over whatever replaced it.
 *
 * Each continuation is exercised separately against each of the four
 * boundaries, rather than one representative case, because they are four
 * independent code paths that happened to share a bug.
 *
 * `clear()` is a boundary in its own right, and it was missed on the first pass:
 * `close()` invalidated in-flight work while `clear()` did not, even though
 * `clear()` is documented as clearing the current query and matches.
 *
 * A harness note that matters more than it looks. `replace()` and `replaceAll()`
 * gate on the *edit-command snapshot* (`find.replace` / `find.replaceAll`
 * enabled), not on `search.getState().canReplace`. The first version of this file
 * supplied no such snapshot, so both methods returned `operation-unavailable`
 * synchronously and never built a promise at all — every replace case passed
 * without once reaching the asynchronous continuation it claimed to test. Adding
 * `editCommands.getSnapshot()` is what made them real, and with it all four
 * continuations genuinely depend on the guard at the close, clear, and
 * editor-change boundaries.
 *
 * Separately: staleness gates the *publication*, never the reported outcome. A
 * worker-backed replace that commits after its session ends still resolves with
 * the settled outcome, because that is what the method documents. An earlier
 * version returned `operation-unavailable` — the reason reserved for "no active
 * match" — telling a caller their edit had not happened when it had.
 *
 * These assert on what the controller *emits*, not on the state it happens to
 * settle at. A stale write is frequently masked: after `close()` a later
 * re-sync reads the now-empty backend and resets the slice, so the final total
 * looks correct even though the old document's matches were published to every
 * observer in between. Asserting the end state passes with the bug present,
 * which is how the first version of this file managed to prove nothing.
