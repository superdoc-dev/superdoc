/**
 * `replaceFile()` swaps content under a stable editor identity.
 *
 * The editor object and its host both survive the swap, so the controller sees
 * no `active-editor-change` and nothing resets. Measured before writing the
 * fix: after an in-place replace, `search.total` still reported the previous
 * document's match count, while the geometry subscription was never detached
 * and stayed attached to the host now rendering the replacement.
 *
 * That split is the whole design. A reset broad enough to cover search would
 * also rebind host-scoped subscriptions that were never stale, so the
 * controller keeps two hook lists and `document-replaced` runs only the
 * document-scoped one. These tests pin both halves: the stale slice resets,
 * and the healthy subscription is left alone.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately the replacement LIFECYCLE — the event, its identity, the
 * search reset, the content caches, and what must survive. Hardening found while
 * investigating this (format painter, host caret store, optimistic formatting,
 * review reconciliation) is tracked separately: those are their own defects and
 * should not ride inside a search-lifecycle fix.
