/**
 * Public boundary guard: tests and fixtures may not reach outside the repository.
 *
 * Fails when a test, fixture, or example references a path that resolves
 * outside the repository root. A public clone has no parent directory, so the
 * reference is either dead on arrival or silently depends on a private sibling
 * checkout that only exists in the development monorepo.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * `superdoc/public` is developed inside a larger private repository where
 * sibling directories like `../v2` and `../labs` really do exist. That makes an
 * escaping path look correct locally and in private CI, and only break for
 * someone who cloned the public mirror. A demo Playwright suite shipped reading
 * its fixture from `../../../../labs/proofing/...` for exactly this reason:
 * nothing asked whether the path survived the export.
 *
 * Why resolution rather than a text ban
 * ------------------------------------
 * Banning the substring `labs/` or `../v2` would flag prose that legitimately
 * names the private repository — policy docs, migration notes, this file — while
 * still missing an escape written a different way. So the check resolves each
 * candidate against the filesystem and reports the ones landing outside the
 * root. Only something that is really a path can fail, and something that is
 * really a path cannot hide behind spelling.
 *
 * What this does not catch
 * ------------------------
 * It reads literal path-shaped strings, so it cannot see a path assembled at
 * runtime (`'../'.repeat(4) + 'labs/x'`), one built from a variable, or an
 * in-repo symlink whose target escapes. Those are real gaps rather than
 * oversights: evaluating them needs a resolver, not a scanner. The guard raises
 * the floor on the common case — a literal specifier in an import or a fixture
 * path — and the export seam remains the backstop for the shipped tree.
 *
 * Callees are matched by the name at the call site, so an aliased import
 * (`import { readdirSync as list }`) is not recognized as a filesystem call.
 * That only matters for a path whose own text does not escape: `list('..')` is
 * missed, while `list('../labs/x')` is still caught, because a literal carrying
 * a traversal is reported wherever it sits. Following the alias means tracking
 * bindings through the module, which is the resolver this deliberately is not.
 *
 * Scope, and what owns the rest
 * -----------------------------
 * This guard covers the surfaces that must run from a bare public clone:
 * tests, fixtures, and examples. It deliberately does NOT scan build
 * wiring, manifests, the lockfile, or runtime modules that consume the private
 * engine during development. Those escape by design and are owned by the
 * porter's `EXPORT_SEAM_VERIFY_RULES`, which rewrites the engine dependency and
 * fails the export if a private marker survives. Two guards, one boundary:
 * the porter proves the shipped tree, this proves the tree developers edit.
 *
 * Run directly:
 *   node scripts/check-public-boundary.mjs
 *   pnpm run check:public-boundary
