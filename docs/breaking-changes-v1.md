# SuperDoc v1.0.0 — Breaking Changes & Migration Guide

This document describes all **breaking changes** between SuperDoc `v0.x` and `v1.0.0`. It is intended for **customers upgrading to v1**.

---

## TL;DR

**SuperDoc v1.0.0 is a major architectural release.**

Key impacts:

* A new **layout engine** is now the default rendering system  
* **Pagination, lists, and paragraph formatting were reimplemented**  
* Several **extensions, commands, and configuration options were removed**  
* **Selection, comments, and tracked-changes behavior changed**

Most applications will require **explicit migration work**.

---

## 1. Version & Packaging

* **Version jump:** `0.35.3 → 1.0.0`  
* This release intentionally includes breaking API and behavior changes  
* v0 will continue to be supported as a "long term support" (LTS) line for some time

### Bundler Requirements (ESM)

SuperDoc v1 introduces a new internal layout engine stack (packages under `@superdoc/*`). You do not need to install these directly—they are dependencies of `superdoc`.

Bundlers must support ESM modules (or be configured to transpile ESM dependencies from `node_modules`).

---

## 2. Layout Engine Is Now Default (CRITICAL)

```ts
new SuperDoc(); // layout engine enabled by default
```

Removed in v1:

* `pagination` config option  
* `togglePagination()` helper  
* Pagination toolbar controls

Pagination is now handled entirely by the layout engine; use `layoutEngineOptions` to customize page size, margins, zoom, and other layout behavior.

---

## 3. Pagination Extension Removed

The v0 `Pagination` extension was **removed**. If you were explicitly including it, remove it from your extensions list.

---

## 4. Lists Reimplemented (HIGH IMPACT)

### Removed Extensions

* `BulletList`  
* `OrderedList`  
* `ListItem`

Lists are now modeled via paragraph properties (`paragraphProperties.numberingProperties`).

**Why this changed:** In Microsoft Word, lists are paragraph-level numbering properties (not separate list nodes). v1 adopts the same model so lists behave like Word and match DOCX semantics.

### Removed Commands

* `wrapInList`  
* `sinkListItem`  
* `liftListItem`  
* `splitListItem`  
* `deleteListItem`

### Replacement Commands

```ts
editor.commands.toggleList('orderedList');
editor.commands.toggleList('bulletList');
editor.commands.increaseListIndent();
editor.commands.decreaseListIndent();
editor.commands.removeNumberingProperties();
```

---

## 5. Paragraph Model Changes (HIGH IMPACT)

### Attribute Location Changed

Most paragraph formatting that previously lived on `node.attrs.*` is now under `node.attrs.paragraphProperties`, including:

* `indent`, `spacing`, `borders`, `justify`  
* `tabStops`, `keepLines`, `keepNext`  
* `styleId`

### New Access Pattern

```ts
// v0
node.attrs.styleId;

// v1
node.attrs.paragraphProperties?.styleId;
```

Paragraph layout is now computed by the layout engine.

---

## 6. Commands & Formatting Changes

### Removed Extensions

* `TextIndent`  
* `LineHeight`

### Replacement Commands

* Indent: `increaseTextIndent()`, `decreaseTextIndent()`, `setTextIndentation(points)`, `unsetTextIndentation()`  
* Line height: `setLineHeight(multiplier)`, `unsetLineHeight()`

---

## 7. TypeScript Support

* Core editor code migrated to TypeScript  
* Strongly typed commands, events, and schema

No runtime behavior change, but imports may need updating.

## 8. CSS & Styling Removals

Removed:

* Pagination CSS  
* List-item CSS  
* Header/footer editor CSS

Rendering is now handled by the layout engine painter.

---

## 9. Ruler Placement Requires a Container

The ruler now teleports into a host element instead of always rendering inline. Pass a container selector/element via `rulerContainer` and enable it with `rulers: true`:

```ts
new SuperDoc({
  rulerContainer: '#ruler-host', // required/strongly recommended
  modules: {
    toolbar: { /* ... */ },
  },
});
```

If no `rulerContainer` is provided, the ruler renders inline, but providing a dedicated container is the supported path going forward.

## 10. DOM Data Attributes for Lists Changed

In v0, list `<li>` nodes emitted many `data-*` attributes (e.g., `data-num-id`, `data-level`, `data-indent`, `data-num-fmt`, `data-font-size`, `data-font-family`, `data-marker-type`, `data-list-level`). In v1, lists are paragraphs with numbering properties, and only these remain on list paragraphs:

* `data-marker-type`  
* `data-list-level` (JSON)  
* `data-list-numbering-type`

All other numbering metadata now lives in `paragraphProperties.numberingProperties` (not in `data-*`). If you scraped DOM attributes for integrations or overlays, read the paragraph attributes/resolved properties instead.

## 11. Stored Document Migration (JSON & Yjs)

Persisted documents created on v0 need migration to load cleanly in v1 because schema and layout defaults changed.

### Yjs collaboration docs (recommended flow)

1. Add your own migration flag (e.g., a string in your document metadata) and check it before running.
2. Export/import to force the v1 importer to rebuild structure:
   - Export DOCX from the v0 document.
   - Import that DOCX with the v1 editor (headless/Node) to produce a new YDoc.
3. Validate the migrated doc.
4. Persist the migration flag in your metadata so it doesn’t rerun.
5. We recommend you keep a pre-migration snapshot for rollback.
6. Store the migrated Yjs update

### Plain JSON docs (non-collab)

If you store ProseMirror JSON, run an export/import pipeline to re-hydrate with the v1 importer:

1. Keep a v0 editor runtime (headless/Node). Load the stored v0 JSON into the v0 editor.
2. Export DOCX from the v0 editor.
3. Instantiate a v1 editor and import that DOCX.
4. Export the new v1 JSON with editor.getJSON()

### Why DOCX export/import?

Using DOCX as the source of truth is the best way to perform this migration. The DOCX data structure is stable and using our import/export is the most reliable way to "upgrade" documents.

## 12. Migration Checklist

1. Upgrade to `superdoc@^1.0.0`  
2. Update TypeScript imports/types if you rely on editor typings  
3. Remove legacy pagination/list/header-footer CSS overrides you no longer need  
4. If you have custom extensions, verify they work correctly  
5. If you have customized any library styles, verify they work correctly

---

## Final Notes

* **v1.0.0 is not a drop-in upgrade**  
* Most breaking changes are architectural and intentional  
* The new layout engine enables accurate pagination, better performance, and long-term stability

If you encounter migration issues, please open an issue with a minimal reproduction.
