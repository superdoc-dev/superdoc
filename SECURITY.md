## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue in SuperDoc, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report it privately through [GitHub’s Security Advisories](https://github.com/superdoc-dev/superdoc/security/advisories/new).  
This ensures the report is only visible to maintainers.

If you prefer email, you can also contact us at: **q@superdoc.dev**

## Our Process

- We will acknowledge receipt within **2 business days**.
- We will provide a status update within **7 days**.
- Once a fix is available, we’ll coordinate a responsible disclosure with you.

Thank you for helping keep SuperDoc and its users safe!
