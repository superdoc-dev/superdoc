// Locates the `@superdoc/font-system` source that this package's build and drift
// checks read, and decides whether its absence is a failure or a legitimate skip.
//
// Why this exists
// ---------------
// Four scripts here reach into `shared/font-system` through the same hardcoded
// relative path, and each one treated a missing path as "not in the monorepo,
// skip". That is right for a standalone install and wrong for this repository:
// if the directory moves or is renamed, every one of them prints a reassuring
// skip line and exits 0. The Verdana-class drift the check exists to catch would
// then ship unnoticed, and `check:families` would be green while checking
// nothing.
//
// The two cases are distinguishable. `shared/` is a workspace of this
// repository, so a checkout whose root manifest is ours is one where font-system
// must be resolvable. A published install is not: `scripts/` is not in this
// package's `files` array, so these scripts only run outside the monorepo when
// someone installs from a git URL and npm runs `prepare`. There, the assets and
// the committed family list already ship in the tree and recomputing them is
// neither possible nor needed.
//
// Keyed on the root manifest's name rather than on `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, which
// every pnpm monorepo has: a consumer who vendored this source into their own
// `packages/fonts/` would otherwise look like us and get a hard failure for a
// check that cannot apply to them.
//
// AIDEV-NOTE: this is the seam #1035 has to repoint when font-system is promoted
// to `packages/font-system`. One constant here, not six paths across four files,
// and the monorepo guard turns a wrong path into a failure rather than a skip.
