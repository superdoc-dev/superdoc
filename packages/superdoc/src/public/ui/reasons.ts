/**
 * Stable public reason taxonomy for the v2-native `superdoc/ui` controller.
 *
 * These strings are the canonical, stable vocabulary the controller uses to
 * explain WHY a command or workflow handle is disabled, unsupported, deferred,
 * or otherwise fails closed. They are part of the public custom-UI contract:
 * consumer toolbars/panels can branch on them and migration docs reference
 * them. Once shipped, a value must not be repurposed — add a new member rather
 * than changing the meaning of an existing one.
 *
 * The reasons distinguish the failure-mode families a custom UI must tell
 * apart (see `plans/v2-custom-ui-toolbar-parity-plan-set.md`, Workstream 2):
 *
 *   - command unsupported by v2            → `command-unsupported`
 *   - reserved recognized/deferred command → `command-deferred`
 *   - editor / Document API not ready yet   → `not-ready`, `document-api-unavailable`
 *   - blocked by viewing / read-only state  → `document-readonly`
 *   - blocked by missing selection/context  → `selection-required`,
 *     `range-selection-required`, `context-unavailable`, `target-unresolved`,
 *     `target-not-visible`, `geometry-unavailable`
 *   - operation / host capability missing   → `operation-unavailable`,
 *     `host-capability-unavailable`, `bulk-decisions-disabled`
 *
 * Geometry results (`viewport.getRect`, `metadata.getRect`) carry a separate,
 * geometry-local `reason` vocabulary (`not-mounted`, `unresolved`,
 * `invalid-target`, `not-ready`, `unavailable`); see `ViewportRectResult`.
 * That vocabulary predates this taxonomy and is intentionally narrower.
