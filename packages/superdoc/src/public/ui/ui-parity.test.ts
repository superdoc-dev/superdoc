/**
 * MODELLED behavioural parity with `v2` for the legacy custom-UI integration.
 *
 * Read the scope before trusting the name. This is a unit-level model, not a
 * live editor replay: the host is a stub, `lists.apply` is a synthetic command
 * implementation, and the toolbar assertion reads `BuiltInToolbar`'s internal
 * item model rather than rendered DOM. No document is loaded and no browser is
 * involved. What it does prove is that the controller and toolbar item state
 * this model produces are byte-identical to what the same model produced on
 * base, which is a real signal about the ownership change and nothing more.
 * Live-browser evidence lives in `tests/cdn-smoke/editor-ui-hybrid.test.ts`.
 *
 * The ownership change in this branch is supposed to be invisible: the built-in
 * toolbar, link popover and shortcut routing stopped building their own
 * controllers and now share the instance's, and an application that already
 * calls `createSuperDocUI()` should not be able to tell. Every other test here
 * asserts a property someone thought to write down. This one asserts something
 * stronger and dumber: that a scripted session produces the state it produced
 * before the change.
 *
 * `ui-parity-baseline.json` was recorded by running this exact scenario, with
 * the same stub host, against `origin/v2` (8d5f82b6b4) in a separate worktree. It is not a snapshot of
 * current behaviour blessed after the fact; regenerating it means checking out
 * base and re-recording, which is the point.
 *
 * The scenario uses only what exists on both revisions: `createSuperDocUI()`
 * plus `BuiltInToolbar`. It never touches `superdoc.ui`, which base does not
 * have. The host does expose `ui`, because a real `SuperDoc` always does, and
 * that is the configuration whose parity matters.
 *
 * Normalization, so a diff means behaviour and not scheduling:
 *  - semantic state only (supported / enabled / active / reason, document mode,
 *    and the toolbar's own rendered flag)
 *  - no timestamps, generated ids, object identity, or event ordering
 *  - a checkpoint is recorded only once two consecutive reads agree, so a
 *    transient mid-recompute value cannot be captured
 *
 * Known and accepted difference, not covered here: a host that does NOT expose
 * `ui` diverges. On base the toolbar built its own controller; here it stays
 * inert by design, rather than becoming a second source of command truth. A
 * real `SuperDoc` always exposes `ui`, so this does not reach an application,
 * but it is a real difference and `#initController` documents the choice.
