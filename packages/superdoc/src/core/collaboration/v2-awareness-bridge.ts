/**
 * Compatibility bridge from the v2 presence runtime to the legacy
 * `awareness-update` public event.
 *
 * The shipped v2 presence facade reports normalized remote-actor snapshots
 * from the bundled browser presence bridge. The legacy
 * public `awareness-update` payload, by contrast, is a v1-shaped
 * `{ states: AwarenessState[], added: number[], removed: number[] }` where
 * `added` / `removed` are numeric client ids.
 *
 * v2 presence identifies actors with stable string ids, not numeric Yjs
 * client ids. To preserve the documented `number[]` public contract this
 * bridge maintains a deterministic string→number registry: each distinct
 * actor key is assigned a stable numeric id the first time it is seen, and
 * that id is reused for the lifetime of the bridge. The local actor always
 * maps to client id `0`.
